    <h2>Éric Rohmer</h2>
    <p class="bio">Maurice Henri Joseph Schérer or Jean Marie Maurice Schérer, known as Éric Rohmer (French: [eʁik ʁomɛʁ], 21 March 1920[1] – 11 January 2010), was a French film director, film critic, journalist, novelist, screenwriter and teacher.

    Rohmer was the last of the post-World War II, French New Wave directors to become established. He edited the influential film journal, Cahiers du cinéma, from 1957 to 1963, while most of his colleagues – among them Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut – were making the transition from film critics to filmmakers and gaining international attention.

    Rohmer gained international acclaim around 1969 when his film My Night at Maud's was nominated at the Academy Awards.[2] He won the San Sebastián International Film Festival with Claire's Knee in 1971 and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for The Green Ray in 1986. Rohmer went on to receive the Venice Film Festival's Career Golden Lion in 2001.

    After Rohmer's death in 2010, his obituary in The Daily Telegraph described him as "the most durable film-maker of the French New Wave", outlasting his peers and "still making movies the public wanted to see" late in his career.</p>

    <h2>Le Rayon Vert<br/>
      (The Green Ray/Summer, 1986)</h2>
    <p class="bio">A spellbinding study of loneliness and the mysterious influence of fate on our lives. Rohmer’s masterpiece stars Marie Rivière in a captivating performance as the highly sensitive Delphine, a Parisien secretary looking for a meaningful connection in a callous and indifferent world. Winner of the Golden Lion at the 1986 Venice Film Festival.</p>

    <h2>Ma nuit chez Maud<br/>
 	(My Night With Maud, 1969)</h2>
    <p class="bio">If he had never made another film Eric Rohmer would have secured a place in cinema history with this brilliantly lucid, clever and compassionate meditation on chance, probability, fate, sex and religion. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays the Catholic engineer with a penchant for Pascal, who falls instantly in love with a woman he’s never met and determines to marry her, but finds his resolution tested when he meets the sophisticated, alluring Maud.</p>
